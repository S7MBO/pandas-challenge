### Background

Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data wrangling mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

### Observable Trends

* The most early and obvious trend is the vast majority of male players at 84%. There is a female fan base for this game at 14%, with the remaining 2% nominating “Other/Non-Disclosed”. Due to the non-male player percentage of 16%, we could focus targeted advertising for these demographics increase player participation.

*	It is clear that peak popularity by age demographic for these games is in the late teens  to mid-twenties range, in particular the 20-24 age bracket at 44%. Players in the 10-14 age bracket is not a significant area to look at as most games would be low here, instead we should look at ways to market the game to an older audience. Games remain extremely popular for players aged 25+ years, where this game seems to lack the player base.

* The money spent per age bracket correlates with the above point – increasing ways to market the game to players aged 25+ would significantly bring in more revenue in money spent in-game.
